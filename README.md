# Council Spending Data

Processed/cleaned versions of public body spending data files. These are further processed for the [ODI Leeds Public Body Spending Explorer](https://odileeds.org/projects/council-spending/) but are provided here so that other people don't have to deal with the horror of inconsistencies in columns, CSV-validity, dates, currency values etc.
